Good start, but to really solve this challenge you need to read more of the EEPROM.
Wich you now have proven that you can do, great! :)

To prove you have full arbitrary code execution, you must light the LED located at pin B5 and make sure it stays lit.
When you have done so, this simulator will become interactive.
