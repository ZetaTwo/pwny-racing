## Challenges

Author: b0bb

The challenge was an 32-bit x86 pwnable. Since the challenge is supposed to be solved blind we will not release it quite yet as we hope to have it hosted soon.
NOTE: We are currently not running the remote server for the challenge. We are working on a solution to have them up but in the meanwhile you can still solve the challenge locally.
