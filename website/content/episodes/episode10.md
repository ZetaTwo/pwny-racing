## Challenges

Author: b0bb

The challenge was an 32-bit x86 pwnable. The challenge can be downloaded here: [Challenge 22](/challenges/chall22-dist.tgz).

NOTE: The goal is always to get full code execution, even if you in some cases can read the flag without it. We are now hosting the remote challenges so that you can try to solve them against our server. However, there is no way to turn in flags or track progress.
