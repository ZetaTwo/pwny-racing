Welcome to Pwny Racing! Pwny Racing is a monthly live streamed head-to-head hacking competition. Four challengers face off to be the first one to solve a pwnable challenge and get the flag while being live commented by our expert commentators.

Pwny Racing is inspired be previous events such as [Rapid Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ndEUvid8S8) and [LiveCTF](https://livectf.blogspot.com/) which we thought were cool ideas and thus wanted to bring back.
The episodes air once a month with dates announced here on the website, on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ZetaTwo) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ZetaTwo).
The Pwny Racing organizing team consists of HackingForSoju members ZetaTwo, b0bb and LarsH.

If you want to get in contact with the Pwny Race organizers, please send an e-mail to [contact@pwny.racing](mailto:contact@pwny.racing).
