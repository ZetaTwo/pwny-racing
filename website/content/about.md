Welcome to Pwny Racing! Pwny Racing was a monthly live streamed head-to-head hacking competition. Four challengers faced off to be the first one to solve a pwnable challenge and get the flag while being live commented by our expert commentators.

Pwny Racing was inspired by previous events such as [Rapid Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ndEUvid8S8) and [LiveCTF](https://livectf.blogspot.com/) which we thought were cool ideas and thus wanted to bring back.
The show ran for a year and the episodes aired once a month with dates announced here on the website, on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ZetaTwo) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ZetaTwo).
The Pwny Racing organizing team consisted of HackingForSoju members ZetaTwo, b0bb and LarsH.
