Do you want to participate in the next Pwny Racing episode? You can!
Every episode we will invite some participants to compete against each other.
However at least one of the spots will reserved for the winner of the monthly community challenge.
In connection to the streamed event, we will release the community challenge.
The challenge will be in the form of a challenge that you need to solve and be the first one to submit the flag.

## Challenges

Here we will post all current and previous community challenges.

### Community challenge 1

The community challenge is a pwnable that we challenge everyone to solve.
[Download the materials](/challenges/chall2-dist.tgz) and develop an exploit for the binary.
When you have a working exploit, you can connect to the remote server and exploit it.
On the server there is an executable called "flag_submitter". To prove that you have successfully exploited the server, you must run this program with your e-mail as an argument.
For example, I would run it as `./flag_submitter calle.svensson@zeta-two.com`.

The first person to solve the community challenge will be invited to the next episode of Pwny Racing.
In case that person can't participate, the offer will go to the second solver and so on.
If you have any questions about the challenge, contact [@ZetaTwo](https://twitter.com/ZetaTwo) or e-mail `contact@pwny.racing`.
